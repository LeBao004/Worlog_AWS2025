If you don’t control costs, they can skyrocket. (And no one wants to be summoned by the finance team or the CFO to explain runaway cloud spending.)\nThat’s why it’s best to proactively manage cloud costs and optimize from day one. In this article, we’ll look at practical ways to manage costs across the three major providers: Azure, AWS, and GCP.\nWhat happens when you don’t control cloud costs Failing to optimize early can lead to very real, painful problems:\nRunaway spending. Without limits or budgets, costs can climb rapidly. Budget overruns and missed KPIs. Projects overspend, casting doubt on “cloud-first” strategies. Higher risk of service suspension. Especially for startups or capped usage, late payments or overages can trigger throttling or pauses. Overprovisioned and wasted resources. You pay for unused compute, storage, and networking that deliver no business value. Reduced flexibility. Overspending forces overly strict controls just to “course-correct.” Slower time-to-market. Teams hesitate to launch resources because costs are unpredictable. Lost competitive edge. Poor cloud efficiency can make you pay 2–3× competitors for the same capability. Eroded leadership trust. Persistent overruns without comparable value make leaders question cloud as a strategy. Optimize before things get worse The most dangerous aspect of unoptimized cloud costs is compounding over time—like interest. Small gaps become heavy burdens, shrinking your ability to innovate. The longer you wait, the more expensive and complex the cleanup becomes—classic technical debt.\nKey mindset: treat cost optimization like tending a garden—regular care, pruning, and adjustments. Start with the biggest, easiest wins, then move into deeper optimizations.\nPlatform-agnostic cost strategies Each major cloud offers tools and methods to help you improve cost and performance. Below are general strategies, followed by provider-specific tips for AWS, Azure, and GCP.\n1) Right-size resources Inventory what you run and how it’s used. If something is underutilized, downsize or reconfigure it.\nAzure: use Azure Advisor to find underutilized VMs. AWS: use Compute Optimizer or Trusted Advisor for EC2, RDS, and Lambda right-sizing. GCP: use Recommender to tune machine types or autoscaler settings for Compute Engine. 👉 Kick off your AWS journey with Managing Compute Costs in AWS (Pluralsight).\n2) Clean up idle resources Cloud can turn into Hoarders fast. Teams create resources; people change roles; VMs, databases, and storage linger unowned. Nobody deletes them for fear of breaking something—classic cloud sprawl.\nFix it:\nKeep good documentation. Audit regularly and remove what’s not needed. Automate cleanup with scripts or policy as code (e.g., Terraform + scheduled jobs). 3) Optimize storage costs Storage often drives surprise bills. Teams pick the wrong tiers or leave orphaned data in expensive classes.\nDo this:\nTrain teams on tiers and their purposes. Define clear allocation and ownership policies. Use archive tiers for cold data (backups, logs, compliance). Automation helpers:\nAzure: Blob Lifecycle Management → shift to Cool/Archive. AWS: S3 Lifecycle Policies, Intelligent-Tiering → move to Glacier/Deep Archive. GCP: Object Lifecycle Management → Standard → Nearline/Coldline. 4) Reduce network egress and fix traffic patterns Network fees are like toll roads—small individually, big in aggregate. Egress charges can silently drain budgets. Understand flows and architect to minimize unnecessary data movement.\nTactics:\nData locality planning: keep data near compute. E.g., app in us-east with DB in Europe = expensive egress. Compression \u0026amp; optimization: enable gzip, optimize images/video, dedupe backups. Traffic analysis: use AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management, GCP Cloud Billing to spot anomalies. Caching: CDN, app-level caches, DB query caching, API caching. Provider aids:\nAzure: ExpressRoute, Traffic Manager. AWS: VPC Endpoints, Global Accelerator, consolidate data regions. GCP: Private Google Access, co-locate services to cut egress. 5) Use AI-powered recommendations Each cloud ships “cost whisperers” that suggest optimizations:\nAzure: Azure Advisor AWS: Compute Optimizer, Cost Anomaly Detection GCP: Recommender API, Active Assist These aren’t “nice-to-haves”—they’re your first line of defense against cost creep. Review and apply recommendations regularly.\n6) Continuous cost monitoring Cost tracking isn’t a one-time task—it’s continuous. Ongoing monitoring catches inefficiencies early and prevents surprise bills. Set up budgets, alerts, and forecasting, using native or third-party tools.\nNative tools:\nAzure: Cost Management, Azure Monitor AWS: CloudWatch, Cost Explorer, Budgets GCP: Billing Dashboard, Cloud Monitoring, BigQuery exports Provider tips:\nAzure: Use Azure Hybrid Benefit (for Windows Server licenses) + Cost Management analytics. AWS: Lean on Trusted Advisor + Cost Explorer for patterns and anomalies. GCP: Use sustained use discounts for long-running workloads and per-second billing for short jobs. Conclusion Hopefully this gives you practical strategies to start optimizing cloud costs today. You now have a strategy toolbox for AWS, Azure, and GCP.

The challenge lies in delivering seamless advertisements (ads) that integrate into content without causing buffering, quality degradation, or playback interruptions that drive viewers away.\nAWS Partner – Olyzon has developed an innovative solution using preconditioned ads from AWS Elemental MediaTailor to achieve this balance.\nIntroducing preconditioned ads for enhanced ad insertion MediaTailor supports preconditioned ads, a feature that enables custom control over the ad transcoding process. This feature, also known as bring-your-own-ads through VAST responses, allows ad decision servers (ADS) to include HLS and DASH manifest URLs for multi-bitrate ad streams that have been pre-transcoded directly in the VAST XML creative file attribute.\nMediaTailor can now stitch these pre-transcoded ad creatives into the manifest without further transcoding. Previously, MediaTailor could only dynamically transcode ads to match the content stream at the time of insertion, causing potential delays in the ad delivery process.\nHow preconditioned ads transform the workflow In the traditional ad insertion workflow, MediaTailor must dynamically transcode ads to match the content stream, store them, and then stitch them into the live stream. This process introduces delays because MediaTailor must wait to receive ads from the ADS\u0026rsquo;s VAST responses before starting transcoding and stitching.\nPreconditioned ads help reduce the time required to insert ads into content by eliminating the transcoding step. These ads must be prepared to match the content stream and already transcoded before use with MediaTailor. The ADS VAST response must include direct links to the pre-transcoded HLS and DASH manifests. MediaTailor only needs to register the ad and stitch it into the content stream, reducing the time between receiving the VAST response and completing ad insertion.\nVAST response requirements for preconditioned ads Unlike typical VAST responses, where MediaTailor receives single creatives and transcodes them into multiple bitrates itself, the ADS must provide correctly formatted VAST responses with pre-transcoded assets.\nVAST Example:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;VAST xmlns:xsi=\u0026#34;[http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance](http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance)\u0026#34; version=\u0026#34;3.0\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Ad id=\u0026#34;ad1\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InLine\u0026gt; \u0026lt;AdSystem\u0026gt;ExampleAdSystem\u0026lt;/AdSystem\u0026gt; \u0026lt;AdTitle\u0026gt;ad1\u0026lt;/AdTitle\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Impression\u0026gt;\u0026lt;![CDATA[[https://example-impression.amazonaws.com](https://example-impression.amazonaws.com)]]\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/Impression\u0026gt; \u0026lt;AdServingId\u0026gt;de8e0d33-9c72-4d77-bb3a-f7e566ffc605\u0026lt;/AdServingId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Creatives\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Creative id=\u0026#34;creativeId1\u0026#34; sequence=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Linear skipoffset=\u0026#34;00:00:05\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Duration\u0026gt;00:00:30\u0026lt;/Duration\u0026gt; \u0026lt;MediaFiles\u0026gt; \u0026lt;MediaFile delivery=\u0026#34;progressive\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;1280\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;720\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;video/mp4\u0026#34; bitrate=\u0026#34;533\u0026#34; scalable=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; maintainAspectRatio=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;![CDATA[[https://example-ad-origin.amazonaws.com/ad1/ad1.mp4](https://example-ad-origin.amazonaws.com/ad1/ad1.mp4)]]\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/MediaFile\u0026gt; \u0026lt;MediaFile delivery=\u0026#34;streaming\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;1280\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;720\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;application/dash+xml\u0026#34; bitrate=\u0026#34;533\u0026#34; scalable=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; maintainAspectRatio=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;![CDATA[[https://example-ad-origin.amazonaws.com/ad1/index.mpd](https://example-ad-origin.amazonaws.com/ad1/index.mpd)]]\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/MediaFile\u0026gt; \u0026lt;MediaFile delivery=\u0026#34;streaming\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;640\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;360\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;application/x-mpegURL\u0026#34; bitrate=\u0026#34;262\u0026#34; scalable=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; maintainAspectRatio=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;![CDATA[[https://example-ad-origin.amazonaws.com/ad1/index_low.m3u8](https://example-ad-origin.amazonaws.com/ad1/index_low.m3u8)]]\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/MediaFile\u0026gt; \u0026lt;MediaFile delivery=\u0026#34;streaming\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;2560\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;1440\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;application/x-mpegURL\u0026#34; bitrate=\u0026#34;1066\u0026#34; scalable=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; maintainAspectRatio=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;![CDATA[[https://example-ad-origin.amazonaws.com/ad1/index_high.m3u8](https://example-ad-origin.amazonaws.com/ad1/index_high.m3u8)]]\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/MediaFile\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/MediaFiles\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Linear\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Creative\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Creatives\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/InLine\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Ad\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/VAST\u0026gt; "},{"uri":"https://thienluhoan.github.io/workshop-template/3-blogstranslated/3.3-blog3/","title":"Blog 3","tags":[],"description":"","content":" ⚠️ Note: The information below is for reference purposes only.

The last day to take the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate (SOA-C02) exam will be September 29, 2025.\nFrom SysOps to CloudOps We are renaming this certification to AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer – Associate to reflect the evolving nature of cloud operations and the change in industry terminology. This change aims to enhance the relevance and credibility of individuals who earn this certification, highlighting their knowledge and skills in deploying, operating, and maintaining workloads on AWS.\nFrom SOA-C02 to SOA-C03 We have updated the exam with the help of subject matter experts (SMEs) and will release a new exam guide on September 9, 2025. A key difference between AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate (SOA-C02) and AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer – Associate (SOA-C03) is that containers are now in scope for SOA-C03.\nWe have included more modern services and features, increased emphasis on multi-account, multi-Region architectures, and more on automation and infrastructure as code. No task statements were removed between exam versions, but the new content outline is more detailed with some reorganization of the task statements.\nCertification maintenance and badges The name change to AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer – Associate will only apply to those who pass the SOA-C03 exam. The name will not be retroactively changed for current holders of the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate certification. Here is what you need to know about certification validity, recertification, and maintaining certified status:\nIndividuals who earned the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate certification are not required to earn the AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer – Associate certification. They can continue to display their certification badge, which will remain active until its expiration date. Individuals who earned the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate certification and subsequently earn the AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer – Associate certification will have a separate badge for each. Their AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate certification will remain active until its expiration date. In the future, these individuals can choose to: Continue to recertify the AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer – Associate certification by passing the latest version of the exam. Recertify both certifications by upgrading to the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional certification before the certifications’ expiration date. Individuals with active AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional and AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate certifications can continue to recertify both by passing the latest version of the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional exam.

A data lake is a centralized, managed, and secure repository to store all your data, both in its raw and processed forms for analysis. Data lakes allow you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics to gain insights and make better business decisions.\nThis blog post is part of a larger series on getting started with setting up a healthcare data lake. In my final post of the series, “Getting Started with Healthcare Data Lakes: Diving into Amazon Cognito”, I focused on the specifics of using Amazon Cognito and Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) to authenticate and authorize users in the healthcare data lake solution. In this blog, I detail how the solution evolved at a foundational level, including the design decisions I made and the additional features used. You can access the code samples for the solution in this Git repo for reference.\nArchitecture Guidance The main change since the last presentation of the overall architecture is the decomposition of a single service into a set of smaller services to improve maintainability and flexibility. Integrating a large volume of diverse healthcare data often requires specialized connectors for each format; by keeping them encapsulated separately as microservices, we can add, remove, and modify each connector without affecting the others.

Solution Architecture The platform applies an AWS Serverless architecture to manage data.\nComponents and Roles in the AWS Architecture A. User Interface Layer Service Role Detailed Description AWS Amplify Website deployment Hosts static websites (React, Vue, Next.js) and automatically builds/deploys when code is pushed to GitHub. Amazon CloudFront (CDN) Improve page loading speed Caches static content (images, CSS, JS) close to users to reduce latency and bandwidth usage. Amazon S3 Store static files \u0026amp; product images Acts as a content repository for images, banners, CSS/JS files. B. Application Logic Layer Service Role Detailed Description Amazon API Gateway API gateway Receives requests from frontend and forwards them to Lambda functions for processing. AWS Lambda Server-side logic Handles order processing, payments, authentication, email sending, without dedicated servers. Amazon DynamoDB NoSQL database Stores products, accounts, orders, shopping carts, offering high speed and automatic scaling. Amazon OpenSearch Service Product search Allows users to quickly search products by keywords, color, price, etc. Amazon EventBridge Event handling Automatically triggers events (e.g., new order → send email, update stock). AWS Secrets Manager Secure sensitive data Stores API keys, payment tokens, database passwords to protect data. C. User Management \u0026amp; Security Layer Service Role Detailed Description Amazon Cognito User authentication \u0026amp; management Supports signup, login, password reset, MFA without building your own auth system. AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) Web protection Protects against SQL Injection, XSS, DDoS, and other malicious access. Amazon Route 53 DNS \u0026amp; domain Manages domain names. D. Notification \u0026amp; Communication Layer Service Role Detailed Description Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) System notifications Sends notifications to admins or users (via email, SMS, or push notifications). Amazon SES (Simple Email Service) Transactional emails Sends order confirmations, promotions, password reset emails, etc. E. AI \u0026amp; Machine Learning Layer Service Role Detailed Description Amazon Translate Content translation Translates product descriptions to other languages for international customers. Amazon Bedrock AI content generation Creates chatbots for shopping assistance. F. Monitoring \u0026amp; Management Layer Service Role Detailed Description Amazon CloudWatch System monitoring Monitors logs, performance, alerts for errors or cost spikes. AWS CloudTrail Administrative logging Tracks configuration changes (who changed what, and when) for auditing purposes. 4.

For example:\nBlog 1 – Guide to 6 strategies and tools for cloud cost optimization on AWS, Azure, and GCP. The article focuses on providing 6 core strategies and practical tools to optimize cloud costs systematically across AWS, Azure, and GCP. The key point is that cost optimization is a continuous and disciplined effort, starting with Right-size resources (adjust resource sizes) and clean up unused resources to avoid waste. Other important strategies include storage cost optimization by choosing the right storage tier, reducing network egress fees by managing data flows, and using each platform’s built-in optimization recommendations (such as Recommender, Trusted Advisor). The ultimate goal is to set up continuous monitoring (budget, alert) to maintain spending performance, helping organizations sustainably reduce costs, increase flexibility, and maintain confidence in their cloud strategy. With a disciplined FinOps practice, you will sustainably reduce costs, increase flexibility, and maintain leadership’s confidence in the cloud strategy.\nBlog 2 – Seamless streaming with preconditioned ads from Olyzon and AWS Elemental MediaTailor The article focuses on a technology solution combining AWS Elemental MediaTailor and Olyzon to solve streaming interruptions caused by ads. The core idea is using preconditioned ads, allowing ads to be pre-transcoded and stitched into the content stream seamlessly, eliminating latency and buffering. Olyzon adds L-shape overlay technology to create less intrusive ads. This solution helps service providers maximize ad revenue (thanks to reliability and no missed impressions) while ensuring an optimal viewer experience.\nBlog 3 – Register now: Updated exam and new name for the cloud operations certification The article focuses on the update and renaming of the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate certification to AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer – Associate (New code: SOA-C03), aiming to reflect the evolution of the Cloud Operations role and changing industry terminology. The key point is the change in the exam’s knowledge scope, including the addition of Containers, a stronger emphasis on automation, Infrastructure as Code, and operating in multi-account/multi-Region environments. This change enables professionals to demonstrate the most modern skills in deploying, operating, and maintaining workloads on AWS, thereby maximizing the credibility and relevance of the certification in the industry.\nBlog 4 - \u0026hellip; This blog introduces how to start building a data lake in the healthcare sector by applying a microservices architecture. You will learn why data lakes are important for storing and analyzing diverse healthcare data (electronic medical records, lab test data, medical IoT devices…), how microservices help make the system more flexible, scalable, and easier to maintain.

Please do not copy verbatim for your report, including this warning.\nHere, you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program. This will help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:\nOverall Evaluation 1. Working Environment\nThe working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think it would be nice to have more social gatherings or team bonding activities to strengthen relationships.\n2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin\nThe mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks, provides necessary documents, and creates favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I especially appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer.\n3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major\nThe tasks I was assigned align well with the knowledge I learned at university, while also introducing me to new areas I had never encountered before. This allowed me to both strengthen my foundational knowledge and gain practical skills.\n4. Learning \u0026amp; Skill Development Opportunities\nDuring the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me better plan my career path.\n5. Company Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still keeps things enjoyable. When there are urgent projects, everyone works together and supports one another regardless of their position. This made me feel like a real part of the team, even as an intern.\n6. Internship Policies / Benefits\nThe company provides an internship allowance and offers flexible working hours when needed. In addition, having the opportunity to join internal training sessions is a big plus.\nAdditional Questions What did you find most satisfying during your internship? What do you think the company should improve for future interns? If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not? Suggestions \u0026amp; Expectations Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience? Would you like to continue this program in the future?
